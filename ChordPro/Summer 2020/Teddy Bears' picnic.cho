If [Am] you go [E7] down to the [Am] woods to-[E7]day
You're [Am] sure of a [E7] big sur- [Am] prise
If [C] you go [G7] down to the [C] woods to- [G7] day
You'd [C] better go [G7] in dis- [C] guise
For [Dm] ev-ry bear that [G7] ever there was
Will [C] gather there for [Am] certain because
To- [F] day's the [C] day the [F] teddy bears [C] have their [G7] pic-[C]nic [E7]

[Am] Every [E7] teddy bear [Am] that's been [E7] good
Is [Am] sure of a [E7] treat to-[Am]day
There's [C] lots of [G7] wonderful [C] things to [G7] eat
And [C] wonderful [G7] games to [C] play
[Dm] Beneath the trees, where [G7] nobody sees
They'll [C] hide and seek as [Am] long as they please
Today's [F] the [C] day the [F] teddy bears [C] have their [G7] pic-[C]nic
[C] Picnic time for teddy bears
The little teddy bears are having a lovely [G7] time today
Watch them, catch them unawares,
And see them picnic on their [C] holiday [F] [G7]
[C] See them gaily gad about,
They love to play and shout, they never have any [F] cares
At [F] six o'clock their mummies and [D7] daddies
Will [C] take them home to [A7] bed
Because they're [Dm] tired little [G7] teddy [C] bears [F] [C]

If [Am] you go [E7] down in the [Am] woods to- [E7] day
You [Am] better not [E7] go a- [Am] lone
It's [C] lovely [G] down in the [C] woods to- [G] day
But [C] safer to [G] stay at [C] home [C7]
For [F] every bear that [G] ever there was
Will [C] gather there to- [F] gether because

To- [C] day's the [F] day the [C] teddy bears [G] have their [C] picnic [C7]
To- [C] day's the [F] day the [C] teddy bears [G] have their [C] picnic [E7]
